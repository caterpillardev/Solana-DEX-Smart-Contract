**The Sui Agent Kit was born from a passion to simplify DeFi development on the Sui blockchain and to empower builders like you for the Sui Overflow 2025 Hackathon!**

We've created a Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation that standardizes how AI agents interact with Sui DeFi protocols. Our toolkit provides ready-to-use MCP tools that allow any AI agent to perform complex DeFi operations on Sui with just one click. We've integrated Navi, SuiSpring, and Suilend protocols into a unified interface, but our goal is to expand this to all protocols in the Sui ecosystem. This eliminates the need for developers to learn multiple SDKs or write custom integration code for each protocol.

Our mission is to provide the foundational infrastructure that enables developers to rapidly prototype, build, and deploy sophisticated DeFi applications, automation scripts, and AI-powered agents on Sui, with a special focus on leveraging the deep liquidity and features of the Navi/Suilend Protocol .

## What is the Sui Agent Kit?
The Sui Agent Kit is a Node.js server application built with TypeScript. It acts as a bridge, translating simple MCP tool calls into direct interactions with the different protocols on the Sui network

## Use Cases 

 - 🌟 Dominate the Infrastructure & Tooling Track: This kit is infrastructure! Showcase a powerful tool that lowers the barrier for Protocol integration and enables a new wave of automated DeFi applications.

 - 🚀 Accelerate Your DeFi & AI Projects: Building for the DeFi or AI tracks? Integrate complex Defi operations (lending, borrowing, swaps, liquid staking) with just a few tool calls. Focus on your unique application logic, not SDK boilerplate.

- 🤖 Build Smarter Agents: The MCP-based architecture is perfect for creating intelligent agents that can manage portfolios, execute DeFi strategies, or provide automated financial services on Sui.

- 💡 Innovate with Ease: Quickly experiment with novel DeFi strategies by scripting interactions with Navi Protocol.

- 🛠️ Focus on Value: Spend less time wrestling with SDKs and more time building the features that will impress the judges.
